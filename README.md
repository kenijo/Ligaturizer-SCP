# Ligaturizer

![Ligature example](images/banner.png)

**Add ligatures to any coding font!**

This script copies the ligatures (glyphs and rendering information) from [Fira Code 3.1](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) into any other TrueType or OpenType font. (Note that the ligatures are scale-corrected, but otherwise copied as is from Fira Code; it doesn't create new ligature graphics based on the font you're modifying.)

Note: Newer FirCode versions would require a heavy rework of the scripts and are not planned.

This repo contains a [Fontforge python script](ligaturize.py) that you can use to add the Fira Code ligatures to any font, as well as submodules for some popular coding fonts and [another script](build.py) for ligaturizing all of them at once.

Pre-ligaturized fonts are available under [releases](https://github.com/kenijo/Ligaturizer/releases).

Here's a an example of Source Code Pro Ligaturized (note the `!=` and `->`):

## Requirements

**This Repo**: You'll need the repo and its submodules, so `git clone` with `--recurse-submodules`.

**Using the Fonts**: See the [FiraCode README](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for a list of supported editors.

**Script**: This script requires FontForge python bindings. For Debian/Ubuntu they are available in `python-fontforge` package. For OpenSUSE and NixOS, they are included in the `fontforge` package. For macOS, they are available via brew (`brew install fontforge`).

## Using the Script

### Automatic

Use automatic mode to easily convert 1 or more font(s).

1. Copy the font(s) you want to ligaturize into `fonts/input/`.
1. Edit `ligatures.py` to disable any ligatures you don't want, and/or enable any (non-ligature) characters you want from Fira Code in addition to the ligatures.
1. Edit `build.py` to add / remove your font(s). It supports globbing, so if (e.g.) you want to ligaturize all the different weights of FooFont you can add `'FooFont*'` to the list.
1. Run `make`.
1. Retrieve the ligaturized fonts from `fonts/output/`.

### Manual

1. Copy the font(s) you want to ligaturize into `fonts/input/`.
1. Edit `ligatures.py` to disable any ligatures you don't want, and/or enable any (non-ligature) characters you want from Fira Code in addition to the ligatures.
1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    $ fontforge -lang py -script ligaturize.py path/to/input/font.ttf \
        --output-dir=path/to/fonts/output/dir/ \
        --output-name='Name of Ligaturized Font'
    ```

    e.g.

    ```bash
    $ fontforge -lang py -script ligaturize.py fonts/SourceCodePro-Regular.ttf \
        --output-dir='fonts/output/' \
        --output-name='Source Code Pro Ligaturized'
    ```

    Which will produce `fonts/output/SourceCodeProLigaturized-Regular.ttf`.

The font weight will be inherited from the original file; the font name will be replaced with whatever you specified in `--output-name`. You can also use `--prefix` instead, in which case the original name will be preserved and whatever you put in `--prefix` will be prepended to it.

`ligatures.py` supports some additional command line options to (e.g.) change which font ligatures are copied from or enable copying of individual character glyphs; run `fontforge -lang=py ligaturize.py --help` to list them.

## Misc

### Credit

This script was originally written by [IlyaSkriblovsky](https://github.com/IlyaSkriblovsky) for adding ligatures to DejaVuSans Mono ([dv-code-font](https://github.com/IlyaSkriblovsky/dv-code-font)). [Navid Rojiani](https://github.com/rojiani) made a few changes to generalize the script so that it works for any font. [ToxicFrog](https://github.com/ToxicFrog) has made a large number of contributions.
